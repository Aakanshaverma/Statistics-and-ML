      "Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured,[1][2] similar to data mining.\n",
      "Data science is a \"concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods\" in order to \"understand and analyze actual phenomena\" with data.[3] It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science.\n",
      "Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a \"fourth paradigm\" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that \"everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology\" and the data deluge.[4][5]\n",
      "In 2012, when Harvard Business Review called it \"The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century\",[6] the term \"data science\" became a buzzword. It is now often used interchangeably with earlier concepts like business analytics,[7] business intelligence, predictive modeling, and statistics. Even the suggestion that data science is sexy was paraphrasing Hans Rosling, featured in a 2011 BBC documentary with the quote, \"Statistics is now the sexiest subject around.\"[8] Nate Silver referred to data science as a sexed up term for statistics.[9] In many cases, earlier approaches and solutions are now simply rebranded as \"data science\" to be more attractive, which can cause the term to become \"dilute[d] beyond usefulness.\"[10] While many university programs now offer a data science degree, there exists no consensus on a definition or suitable curriculum contents.[7]\n",
      "The term \"data science\" has appeared in various contexts over the past thirty years but did not become an established term until recently.

      "In an effort similar to Dhar's, Stanford professor David Donoho, in September 2015, takes the proposition further by rejecting three simplistic and misleading definitions of data science in lieu of criticisms.[32] First, for Donoho, data science does not equate to big data, in that the size of the data set is not a criterion to distinguish data science and statistics.[32] Second, data science is not defined by the computing skills of sorting big data sets, in that these skills are already generally used for analyses across all disciplines.[32] Third, data science is a heavily applied field where academic programs right now do not sufficiently prepare data scientists for the jobs, in that many graduate programs misleadingly advertise their analytics and statistics training as the essence of a data science program.[32][33] As a statistician, Donoho, following many in his field, champions the broadening of learning scope in the form of data science,[32] like John Chambers who urges statisticians to adopt an inclusive concept of learning from data,[34] or like William Cleveland who urges to prioritize extracting from data applicable predictive tools over explanatory theories.[16] Together, these statisticians envision an increasingly inclusive applied field that grows out of traditional statistics and beyond.\n",
      "For the future of data science, Donoho projects an ever-growing environment for open science where data sets used for academic publications are accessible to all researchers.[32] US National Institute of Health has already announced plans to enhance reproducibility and transparency of research data.[35] Other big journals are likewise following suit.[36][37] This way, the future of data science not only exceeds the boundary of statistical theories in scale and methodology, but data science will revolutionize current academia and research paradigms.[32] As Donoho concludes, \"the scope and impact of data science will continue to expand enormously in coming decades as scientific data and data about science itself become ubiquitously available.\"[32]\n"

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured,[1][2] similar to data mining. Data science is a \"concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods\" in order to \"understand and analyze actual phenomena\" with data.[3] It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science. Turing award winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a \"fourth paradigm\" of science (empirical, theoretical, computational and now data-driven) and asserted that \"everything about science is changing because of the impact of information technology\" and the data deluge.[4][5] In 2012, when Harvard Business Review called it \"The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century\",[6] the term \"data science\" became a buzzword.
